Logistic Regression: Binary Classification

âœ… Objective: Build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. data.csv

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas â€“ data loading and manipulation
Scikit-learn â€“ for logistic regression, preprocessing, metrics
Matplotlib â€“ data visualization (ROC Curve)
ðŸ“Œ Steps Performed:

1.Loaded the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from sklearn.datasets. 2.Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20). 3.Standardized features using StandardScaler. 4.Trained a Logistic Regression model on the scaled data. 5.Predicted class labels and probabilities on test data. 6.Evaluated model using:

Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
ROC-AUC Score
ROC Curve visualization 7.Experimented with a custom decision threshold (0.3) to observe performance impact.
ðŸ“ˆ Key Concepts Demonstrated

Binary classification using Logistic Regression
Sigmoid function and probability interpretation
Model performance evaluation using multiple metrics
Threshold tuning to balance precision and recall
ROC Curve and AUC understanding
